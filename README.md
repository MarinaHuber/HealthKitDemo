# Workout Detail Test App

The goal of the project is to make a route map with an overlay with charts which show more detail of a trip.

## Stories

- As a user I can import a GPX file into Apple Health. The file will be provided and can be included in the project.
- As a user I can see a route of my session. All data should be read from Apple Health
- As a user I can a chart of my speed across the session
- As a user I can see a chart of my pace across the session
- As a user I can see a chart of my heart rate across the session

![Wireframes - the app can be quite "vanilla" and should not need be a pixel perfect from these wireframes. That said, the "cards" paradigm is important](https://cln.sh/DaBD8f/download)

## Notes

- App can be either UIKit, SwiftUI or a hybrid
- You can use any third party dependencies you see fit, but be prepared to explain why you chose them
    - We use [PanModal](https://github.com/slackhq/PanModal) for the popover cards at the moment
    - [CoreGPX](https://github.com/vincentneo/CoreGPX) is a good GPX library
- Remember to include time for demoing your app and other communications that may come up
